**TIP CALCULATOR APP V1.0**


The Tip Calculator App is a mobile app I am making as a project to help improve my skills in Kotlin Android App Development.

Its purpose is to calculate the tip and total amount to be paid when paying the bill in a restaurant/cafe/similar settings, according to how much you wish to pay as a "%" measure.

The app is meant to be basic and is a tool for me to try out and learn new features in Android App Development, mostly by following along with tutorials, so that I can eventually work on my on Android App that I have in mind.

Here are the features I plan on implementing in this app mapped according to versions:

-- v1.0 : Basic Functionality - Calculating tips and total amount based on a base amount of payment and tipping percentage using a slider.

-- v1.1 : Design Updates - Adding slight animations and updates to the color theme to improve the app interface

-- v1.2 : Opening Page - To add a page that shows up upon opening the app and moves to the main page automatically to give it a more professional look.

-- v1.3 : Adding Animation - Adding an animation to the opening page to improve the aesthetics of the app

-- v1.4 : Additional Functionality - Adding the "Split Bill" feature to split your bill among other members of your party along with detailed breakdown of tip and total amount to be paid by each member.

-- v1.5 : "Carry" Feature - When splitting bills among members of the party, not everyone is able to - financially, morally or otherwise - pay the same fraction of the bill as others and others "carry" the group financially. So this feature will allow the breakdown of how much each member pays and adjust it in a smart manner.

-- v1.6 : Design Update - Improving upon the design and animations made so far

-- v1.7 : Memory Update - Including the functionality for the app to store previous bill payments locally, including all details about tip percentage, member-wise breakdown and the ability to edit previous payments for any errors made, with a log of all updates made previously.

These are all the features I have thought of implementing in the app for now. There are more features I may implement upon reaching v1.7, like online sharing, etc.
